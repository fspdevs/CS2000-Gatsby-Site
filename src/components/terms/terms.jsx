            important to advise our applicants that, on occasion, we may obtain
            information from credit bureaus to underwrite applications. As our
            Merchant Cash Advance (MCA) business funding differs greatly from
            loans, we do request credit, personally identifiable and financial
            information for the purpose of determining the creditworthiness of a
            merchant who seeks to sell their future receivables.

          <h2 >Factor Rates</h2>
          <p >
            By visiting our website, you’re likely looking for a financial
            funding solution to grow your business or address a challenge that
            arises. As an informed business owner, you should weigh the options
            of what type of business funding to choose, and what type of
            interest comes with that choice. Any funding your business receives,
            whether it be from a loan or Merchant Cash Advance (MCA) comes with
            a cost to finance. Because of their consumer experiences with
            mortgages, car purchases, etc.; many are familiar with the term
            annual percentage rate (APR), a figure commonly associated with
            credit cards and other consumer funding options. However, if you
            choose the quicker MCA type of funding to fulfill your business
            needs, the cost of financing comes in the form of a factor rate. As
            many may not be familiar with Factor Rates, we at Capital Source 2000
            want to help you understand the difference so you can make an
            informed choice that will best help your business.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            First, interest rates like APRs are associated with loans. Factor
            Rates are associated with Merchant Cash Advances (MCAs). As opposed
            to lending you money, MCAs purchase (or “Factor”) future receivables
            based on an evaluation of your business receipts. With an interest
            rate (APR) on a loan, your payments can actually have a moving
            target because the rate will be recalculated over the course of your
            financing, based on the depreciating capital in an unpredictable
            market-based economy.{' '}
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <pr>
            On the other hand, factor rates are based on your receivables,
            calculated up front and never change. Rather than make recurring
            payments as you would with a standard loan, you’ll pay the full
            amount disclosed up front in a pre-disclosed payment plan that’s
            automatically drafted though ACH drafts.
          </pr>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Understanding the differences between Factor Rates (Merchant Cash
              Advances) and APRs (Loans):
            </strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <LI>
              <strong>They are different types of transactions.</strong> Annual
              Percentage Rates (APR) are percentages that determine the annual
              rate of interest a business owner is charged for borrowed capital.
              The calculation is typically close to the prime rate set by
              markets. On the other hand, factor rates are most commonly
              represented as a fixed decimal number which determines the total
              amount of capital that business owners are obligated to pay upon
              the sale of a fixed period of their future receivables.{' '}
            </LI>
            <LI>
              <strong>
                Factor rates are typically associated with merchant cash
                advances (MCAs).
              </strong>{' '}
              MCAs differ from small business loans as they are a fixed sale of
              receivables, and not a loan. Similar to an APR, Factor rates are
              calculated as decimals ranging from 1.1 to 1.5. If you multiply
              your factor rate by the amount of future receivables you sold for
              the MCA, you can arrive at the factor rate. So, if you receive an
              MCA of $100,000 with a 1.25 factor rate, you’ll have sold $125,000
              in future receivables by the end of the payment period.
            </LI>
            <LI>
              <strong>How it differs from Loans and APR.</strong> Loans operate
              differently from cash advances in that you’ll pay different
              amounts as you pay back the loan (principal vs. interest). APR
              also enters all of the miscellaneous, unforeseen, tangential costs
              of a loan into the equation. In layman’s terms, the APR is the
              rate you’ll actually have to pay on a loan in order to borrow
              money. So if your given rate is five percent, your APR might be
              5.5 – 5.8%, depending on other cost factors by the time you sign
              your contract.
